PEERS

Peers is a project which goal is to facilitate communication
between persons and machines over the internet.
When we develop a networking application, we often have to
face the problem of NAT traversal. Peers is here to ease
the developer work providing an API to traverse NATs.

For the moment, this is just an experimental API. This is even
not an API for the moment, just classes that will make some
preparation for the network and then send UDP packets to a
peer on the network. The couple of computers, each one behind
a NAT (Port restricted Cone NAT) will send and receive UDP
packets containing "hello world" and the current time in
milliseconds.

To access another peer on the network you use its identifier.
For example you can use a ne-mail address. This e-mail address
is registered on a database and when you launch the program,
it will update its public address in the database.

BUILD

To build and launch Peers client program, you have to install
a JDK 1.6 (Sun's one has been used for dev). You should also
install the latest version of Ant (apache). Thus you just have
to type ant in the current directory in a command line once you
have downloaded the SVN tree.
