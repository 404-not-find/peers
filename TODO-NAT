NAT simulation:

The following classes can be created to emulate a real NAT on
only one host to ease tests:

 - IPNode: contains one or more NetworkInterfaces
 - NetworkInterface: IPAddress + ports, send & receive methods,
     references an EthernetLink
(- Port: number + boolean (open/closed), references a NetworkInterface)
 - NAT: general type for NATs, contains two NetworkInterfaces (and
     a collection of Glues between its NetworkInterfaces)
 - Glue: association between a NetworkInterface + input port and a
     NetworkInterface + output port, a Glue only lives 30s (with UDP
     implementation)
 - PortRestrictedConeNAT: NAT that accept all incoming packets from
     its input and rejects all packets coming from outside, except
     when a packet has already been sent to the specified address
 - Simulator: NAT simulation manager which creates network nodes and
     their interfaces, addresses, and the links between these nodes.
 - EthernetLink: contains a list of IPNodes.
